# CryptoAllowance

A wallet coded in solidity that can be used as a weekly allowance distributor. 

Before deploying contract go through the code and make changes to visibility on the functions depending on your usecase.

Deployed with solidity 0.8.0 for its already built in safe math. I highly recommend only using this version and up for safe code.

front end coming soon.
